This project was made using node.js and allows users to quickly generate a readme file. Once a user initiates node in their terminal on index.js, a series of questions will appear asking them for their Github Username, email address, project name, project description, licenses, install/test commands, fyi, and how to make contributions. After finishing the series of questions, a readme file will be generated in markdown language. The main portions of this readme were generated using the README Generator.
